The qm7 folder contains many different molecules all in their own xyz file and then there is one file called hof_qm7.txt that contains the energies for each .xyz file.

The local_slatm_qm7_light.bz contains the first 100 samples of the qm7 (dictionary keys: 'descriptor', 'zs', 'energies').

The local_slatm_ch4cn.bz and local_slatm_ch4cn_light.bz contain the local slatm descriptor, the zs and the kJ/mol demeaned energies (CCSD) for the CH4 + CN data set generated in VR. The full version has 17864 samples, while the light version has 100 samples.
